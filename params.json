For our infrastructure, we used CodeShip and Heroku.\r\n\r\n### Interesting Engineering Practices\r\nThe way we stored survey, question, and response information required careful a setup of the database schema. Since we support multiple question types. We created one table that can store all question types, but individual table columns could are nullable. \r\n\r\n### Architecture Diagram\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis was made by Tiffany Chen (@tiffwchen), Josh Kerxhalli-Kleinfield (@ursinewalrus), David Barsky (@davidbarsky), and Yoseph Tesfagaber.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
