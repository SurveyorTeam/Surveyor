{"name":"Surveyor","tagline":"The best to conduct research on millennials.","body":"### Welcome to Surveyor.\r\nSurveyor is a survey creation tool.\r\n\r\n### Technologies Used\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Interesting Engineering\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThis was made by Tiffany Chen (@tiffwchen), Josh Kerxhalli-Kleinfield (@ursinewalrus), David Barsky (@davidbarsky), and Yoseph Tesfagaber.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
